# Introduction to Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the popular classification technique of determining attidues around a subject, entity, or event from natural language. The method and techniques of implementing sentiment analysis are long and well-documented from "simple" and inuitive models such as logistic regression and Naive Bayes Classifier and training models using a collection of vocabulary words (Bag of Words) to highly sophisticated and state of the art large language/reasoning models such as GPT-4, o4, BERT, Claude Opus 4 trained on large corpus of text throught the use of embeding layers that preserve word order, sentiment analysis seems to be a persistent and well researched topic surrounding these forementioned methods of prediction.

Recent improvements in the sophistication of model architecture from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) being popular methods for sentiment analysis, the rise of attention based architecture and Transformers presented in Attention Is All You Need,
